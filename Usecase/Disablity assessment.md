# ‚ùó Logic, Validation, and Messages
The [Washington Scale Short Survey](https://www.washingtongroup-disability.com/question-sets/wg-short-set-on-functioning-wg-ss/) asks the following six questions; all are mandatory:-

1. VISION: Do you have difficulty seeing, even if wearing glasses? 
2. HEARING: Do you have difficulty hearing, even if using a hearing aid(s)?
3. MOBILITY: Do you have difficulty walking or climbing steps?
4. COGNITION: Do you have difficulty remembering or concentrating? 
5. SELF-CARE: Do you have difficulty with self-care, such as washing all over or dressing? 
6. COMMUNICATION: Using your usual language, do you have difficulty communicating, for example understanding or being understood?

**Each question has one of four possible answers:**
- No difficulty
- Some difficulty
- A lot of difficulty
- Cannot do at all

##### NOTE - A newly created WG-SS record of a patient can be edited only on the same day.
